# session1-containers

In this session we covered, building and running of a basic container application. Of course there is still lots of concepts we didnt cover. A lot more information about the CLI can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/

Nearly all of the docker CLI commands work using podman.

What we will be covering in the next session, is how to both deploy this image and deploy an application in a kubernetes environment. It will follow similar to this sessions but how to implement both the persistance of storage and networking for an application in a cloud environment.

Any questions about anything in this session and containers in general, Im happy to have a chat via email or on slack.
